Gauss constrained basis for SU(N) Lattice Gauge Theory with Tensor Networks

We construct a basis for (d+1) dimensional SU(N) Kogut-Susskind lattice gauge theory
in which all gauge constraints are explicitly enforced, by extending the lattice Hilbert
space so that all degrees of freedom may be localized at the vertices,
which allows the imposition of the Gauss law at each vertex.

We present a tensor network formulation of (1+1) lattice gauge theory using
the Gauss constrained basis, and test our approach by calculating
the ground state energy and entanglement entropy of (1+1) SU(2) gauge theory
with staggered fermions.
